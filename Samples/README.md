## Sample Pages
These samples demonstrate several common ways of utilizing Sage PaymentsJS:
- *Modal* — display the UI over the page content in a modal dialog that appears when a `<button>` or `<a>` is clicked
- *Inline* — display the UI inside a `<div>`
- *RequireJS* — reference PaymentsJS on a page that uses RequireJS
- *Dynamic* — use a simple ajax call to delay initialization
- *JS-Only* — bypass the `PayJS/UI` module and power your own payment form using the underlying JS library
- *Adaptive* — see the UI adapt to various container sizes
- *Tokens* — store a credit card in the Vault, and then use that token to charge the card in the future
